I have uploaded a ZIP. Extract it, then recursively open the full contents of every .js, .md, and .css file in all folders and subfolders, 
and load all lines into your working memory before doing any analysis. 
One of the .md files is written to guide your understanding of the project (0.0.70c-qol-exploration-summary.md) — read that file first and treat it as the authoritative overview for the entire project.

Perfect! What do you think of the projects code structure? Is it good? Anything to improve? Are the scripts too heavy in code so we need to modularize or refactor, or are we good to go with 0.0.70c?

Rules: 
1. Don't put code temporarily to already existing scripts if we don't intend to keep them there in the future (like we've done to game.js before).
Create new scripts if we're working on new modules to keep the project modular already from the beginning.

2. Never guess what's in my scripts and write hypothetical code. Always read the scripts from the .zip or ask me to send the code in the chat.
